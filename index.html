<p>Two years ago Nike came to us to realize an idea:
   a device that tracks your daily activity and a
   common universal metric called Fuel for every
   active body out there. They asked us to design
   the entire user experience. We ensured ease of
   use: set your goal, animations celebrate your
   performance. Hit a streak and Fuelie shows up
   to cheer you on. Data visualization show where
   you were most active daily, weekly, monthly, and
   beyond. We created Bluetooth synch technology so
   when you finish your day, your Fuel is wireless
   synced to the platform. NikeFuel levels the playing
   field, and fits into your life. #Counts</p>
